INFO FOR DEVELOPERS:
	- See ./doc/ds/index.html
	- Code is doxygen documented. You can build it with "make doc".
		You can then find the doxygen documentation (including BUGS, FIXMEs and
		TODOes) in ./doc/doxygen/html/index.html
	- There used to be various help files here too. They are now in ./doc/devel
		now.
	- ./doc/devel/build.txt For instructions on how to compile this package.
	- ./doc/devel/NOTES_ON_SIGNALS.TXT Some notes I took before doing the
		signal callbacks implementation of Analog Input ( Old versions of the
		device used to always do polling to check if there is new
		data available).
	- ./doc/devel/AdlinkIODS_Notex.txt Old notes, but some points may still
		be valid...
	- ./doc/devel/AdlinkIODS.latex One day this will be the only information
		source besides doxygen. So it's some more notes. This can be compiled
		into PDF using latex. It's the best entry point into this DS after
		having read QuickStart.txt.
