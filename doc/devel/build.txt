Before building this device server, you will need to load some environment variables.
You can do it this way:

rsune@pc100$ . prepare

Edit "prepare" to set the variables according to you system. There may be more
variables, look at the Makefiles and search for them.
In newest Makefiles(now only aio/) you should search "?=" and it will give you a good info.
In older Makefiles search for DEF_, as DEF_TANGO_HOME for example will contain
the default value for TANGO_HOME.
